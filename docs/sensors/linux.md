# Linux Sensor

eBPF probe design (tracepoints/kprobes), ring buffers, userspace loader, kernel version
support matrix, and GPLv2 licensing boundary.

Container coverage position: containerized workloads (Docker/containerd) share the
host kernel, so the eBPF sensor already observes their execs/connects/file writes —
detection works on container activity today. What container *support* adds is
context (container id + image attribution via cgroups, overlayfs path normalization)
and container-aware content — not a separate container-security product; deep
container runtime security (Falco's territory) and Kubernetes context remain
explicitly out of scope until after v1.

**Status (issue #80):** Attribution foundation landed — `EventMeta::container`
(`ContainerContext.id`) is resolved on every exec/file-open/connect event from
`/proc/<pid>/cgroup` (cgroup v1 `/docker/<id>` and v2 `docker-<id>.scope` /
`cri-containerd-<id>.scope` naming both handled; Kubernetes' `kubepods` nesting is
transparent to the same matching, its pod/namespace context is not extracted).
`image`/`name` are always `None` for now — they need a cached Docker/containerd
socket lookup, deferred to a follow-up PR. Overlayfs path normalization and the
container-aware content (docker-exec lineage, docker.sock mount, privileged-escape
indicators) are also follow-ups; none of the three "Done when" lab-validation items
on #80 are closed by this foundation alone.

**Status (issue #91, BPF-LSM):** Observation-only foundation landed —
`crates/sensors/linux/lsm` loads/attaches the `file_open` LSM hook (compiled into the
same eBPF object as the tracepoint probes) and counts hits, proving the hook fires
regardless of entry path. It never denies (`-EPERM` inline blocking needs a verdict
from `crates/response`/`crates/policy`, which don't exist yet — issues #131, #133).
`bprm_check`/`socket_connect` hooks, a real event feed from this path (vs. the
tracepoint-sourced one), and all three lab-validated "Done when" items on #91 are
follow-ups — this machine has no way to validate a real attach (root needed, and no
confirmation "bpf" is a registered LSM here even though the BTF type is present).

**Status (issue #92, netlink sensors):** Foundation landed for all three —
`crates/sensors/linux/netlink` queries TCP listening/established sockets (IPv4 + IPv6)
via a hand-rolled `NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG` client, joined to owning PID(s) via a `/proc` fd
scan (the same technique `ss`/`lsof` use); verified unprivileged against this dev
machine's real kernel — no root needed for `sock_diag`, confirmed empirically.
`dump_conntrack()` (`NETLINK_NETFILTER`/`ctnetlink`) decodes the kernel's conntrack
table (IPv4 + IPv6): both directions' 5-tuple, status, timeout, and packet/byte
accounting when the kernel provides it — the recursive `nlattr` tree this needed
(`CTA_TUPLE_ORIG` -> `CTA_TUPLE_IP` -> `CTA_IP_V4_SRC`) is what made conntrack "a
distinct netlink sub-protocol" rather than a `sock_diag`-sized job, confirmed against a
real capture on this dev machine byte for byte before being pinned into tests.
Accounting requires `net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1` on the target kernel — off by
default, confirmed empirically (no `CTA_COUNTERS_*` attribute appears at all until it
is turned on). Unprivileged reachability of conntrack is not characterized (every
capture here ran as root). `CTA_PROTOINFO`'s TCP state (`CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP` ->
`CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP_STATE`) is now decoded too — a third level of `nlattr` nesting,
only present for TCP flows (confirmed empirically: UDP dump entries carry no
`CTA_PROTOINFO` attribute at all). The sibling wscale/flags sub-attributes are decoded
on the wire but not surfaced, same scoping call as `CTA_STATUS`'s individual bits.
`ProcEventSubscription` (`NETLINK_CONNECTOR`, `CN_IDX_PROC` group) decodes live
fork/exec/exit broadcasts — root/`CAP_NET_ADMIN`-only, confirmed against this dev
machine (the kernel rejects an unprivileged subscribe with `EPERM`, reported back as a
`NetlinkError`, not a panic); verified end to end against the real kernel as root.

**Status (issue #92, schema wiring):** Listening sockets now reach `schema::Event` —
`listen_port_events()` maps a snapshot to `Event::ListenPort` (schema v10 -> v11),
resolving each joined PID's `comm`/`ppid`/`gid` from `/proc/<pid>/status` (uid is
kernel-reported by `sock_diag` itself, no `/proc` read needed for that one). An
unattributable PID (exited between the two queries, or another user's process) is
silently skipped, not emitted with fabricated metadata.
Conntrack flows now reach `schema::Event` too — `conntrack_flow_events()` maps a
`dump_conntrack()` dump to `Event::NetworkFlow` (schema v11 -> v12, `local_port`
added on top in v12 -> v13 — see below). A conntrack entry carries no PID from the
kernel at all (unlike `sock_diag`'s inode join), so attribution instead joins the
flow's tuple against a concurrent `sock_diag` snapshot's `local`/`remote`/state —
two orientations are checked (this host as the connection's initiator, or as the
one accepted into), since `ctnetlink` doesn't say which end `orig` started from,
and the `orig`/`reply` byte counters are swapped accordingly before becoming
`bytes_sent`/`bytes_received` for whichever orientation matched. TCP only
(`sock_diag` here never queries UDP, so a UDP flow can never match); a flow
nothing could attribute produces no event, same discipline as listening sockets.
Proc connector's own schema/`tamper` wiring is still explicitly deferred past this
slice — see the crate doc's "Deliberately not here yet" section for why (its role
is a `tamper` cross-check that may not want to be a `schema::Event` in the first
place).

**Status (issue #92, caller/detection wiring, PR #193):** The caller that was
missing above now exists — `agent`'s Linux `run` command spawns a background
poller (`sock_diag` + conntrack, 10s cadence) that feeds both event kinds to the
same `DetectionSink` the eBPF sensor uses, shared via a new
`impl<T: EventSink> EventSink for Arc<T>` in `schema::sensor`.
`NetworkFlowEvent` gained `local_port` (schema v12 -> v13) — the stable per-flow
identity the beacon rule below needs, already computed internally for the
`sock_diag` join but not previously exposed. `crates/rules::check_beacon_flow`
closes the "conntrack features reach the correlator for a beacon scenario"
done-when: same T1071/T1041 rule as the existing `ConnectEvent`-driven
`check_beacon`, fed by `NetworkFlowEvent` instead, deduped by `local_port` so a
poll-based source doesn't mistake one long-lived flow re-polled several times for
several distinct connections (the false-positive a naive per-poll counter would
otherwise produce on any ordinary long-lived session). `crates/correlator` also
now pushes `NetworkFlow` to its bus (`is_correlated`), deliberately without a new
co-occurrence rule or `BehaviorVector` feature yet — see that crate's `event.rs`
for why. Listen-port drift detection (the other done-when) and the proc-connector
cross-check (`tamper`) are not part of #193 — see the sections above/below.

**Status (issue #93, journald):** Foundation landed — `crates/sensors/linux/journal`
tails `journalctl -f -o json` (subprocess, not `libsystemd` FFI — see the crate's
`tail` module doc for why) and classifies an allowlist: sshd accept/fail, PAM
session open/close (any `pam_unix` service, not just sudo), sudo command lines, and
systemd unit start/stop/fail. No `schema::Event` variant yet — the issue's own text
says this event type is shared with Windows 4624/macOS login, and that type does not
exist in `schema` today, so it needs a cross-platform design pass before a Linux-only
PR bakes one in. sshd/`su` classification is built against the standard, documented
log line formats but unverified against a real capture (no `sshd` on this dev box,
`su` needs interactive auth this session can't provide) — lab validation is a
follow-up, same discipline as #91.
