# Telemetry Source Inventory

What the agent can observe, organized to answer two questions in order:

1. **What kind of information do we get?** — the coverage tables lead with the
   signal domain (process, file, network, memory, identity, …). All three
   platforms use the same domain list in the same order, so cross-platform
   parity is readable at a glance: a domain `used` on one platform and
   `planned` or `gap` on another is exactly the coverage difference.
2. **Where does it come from?** — each platform first lists its **master
   sources** (ETW, `EndpointSecurity`, eBPF, …) once, with cost/privilege and
   the empirical findings stated there instead of repeated per row; the
   coverage rows then reference a master by name (`ETW · Kernel-Process`), so
   everything one master delivers groups visually.

Status of a row: **used** (code on `main`), **built** (code on `main`, runtime
prerequisite outstanding), **planned** (issue filed), **gap** (no mechanism
evaluated yet — named so it stays a visible decision), **rejected** (per
platform, where the reason is the row). MITRE tags are the techniques as
actually tagged in `crates/rules`/`correlator`, not aspirational mappings.

## Linux

See [linux-telemetry-matrix.md](linux-telemetry-matrix.md) for the full
hook/fields/overhead/kernel/OSS-comparison detail behind each mechanism,
including the evaluated-but-not-implemented tier (fanotify, fentry, SELinux
AVC, seccomp, …) and the SELinux-on-server validation gap.

### Master sources

| Source | Mechanism | Cost & privilege (as observed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **eBPF** | tracepoints, uprobes, BPF-LSM hooks — ring buffers, in-kernel filters | Low overhead. Root or `CAP_BPF`+`CAP_PERFMON`; 5.10+ practically (CO-RE), LSM 5.7+. Capability probed at startup, never a hardcoded version |
| **netlink** | `sock_diag`, conntrack, proc connector, `NETLINK_AUDIT` multicast | Low (10s polls). `sock_diag` confirmed **unprivileged** empirically; proc connector root-only (`EPERM`); audit needs `CAP_AUDIT_READ`. Audit is the designated eBPF fallback — degraded, honest (`parent_lineage: false`) |
| **journald** | `journalctl -f -o json` subprocess tail, allowlist-first | Medium (subprocess + JSON per line). Root in practice — journald's per-unit read ACL blocks unprivileged auth reads (empirical) |
| **/proc, /sys** | event-triggered reads + startup seeding — never a /proc-wide poll loop | Low; mostly unprivileged |
| **device-control** | udev/uevent netlink device notifications | Planned (#84); root for the uevent socket |
| **inventory** | scheduled state snapshots, diffed | Snapshot cadence, not events |

### Signal coverage

| Focus | Source | What we get | Status | MITRE | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Process execution** | eBPF · tracepoints | exec/fork/exit with argv, comm, uid/gid, lineage | used | T1059 | #262 |
| **Process execution** | netlink · audit | fallback exec + connect where eBPF is unavailable (lockdown, old kernel) | used | T1059 degraded | #34/#247 |
| **Process execution** | eBPF · tracepoints | security-relevant exec environment (`LD_PRELOAD` family), present-only allowlist — never the whole env | planned | T1574.006 | #363 |
| **File activity** | eBPF · tracepoints | open/write/delete/rename/chmod/chown with paths + attribution; noisy /dev,/proc,/sys,/tmp filtered | used | T1105, T1485/T1486, T1070.004, T1222 | #262 |
| **File activity** | eBPF · BPF-LSM | `file_open` at the security decision point — deliberate double observation (blinding check), io_uring-proof vantage; inline-block ready | used | T1562 context | #91 |
| **File activity** | eBPF · BPF-LSM | timestomping via `inode_setattr` hook | planned | T1070.006 | matrix row |
| **Network** | eBPF · tracepoints | connect/bind/listen/accept, UDP sends — discrete, real-time | used | T1071/T1041, backdoor listeners | #263 |
| **Network** | netlink · sock_diag+conntrack | listening-port snapshots (LISTENER-DRIFT), flow 5-tuples + byte counters | used | beacon volume features | #92 |
| **Network** | eBPF · tracepoints | mount/umount → platform-neutral v21 `Mount` | planned | staging, evidence destruction | #362 |
| **DNS** | eBPF | query/answer joined to the resolving process (udp:53 parse vs. `getaddrinfo` uprobe — choice in-issue) | planned | T1071.004, DGA features | #267 |
| **Encrypted traffic** | eBPF · uprobes | TLS plaintext pre-encryption/post-decryption (OpenSSL/BoringSSL/GnuTLS), byte-budgeted + redacted | used | T1071 C2 visibility without MITM | #90 |
| **Encrypted traffic** | eBPF | JA4 fingerprint + SNI on connects | planned | C2 tooling fingerprints | #86 |
| **Scripts & shells** | eBPF · uprobes | interactive shell input (readline) incl. builtins that never exec | used | T1059 | #90 |
| **Memory & injection** | eBPF · tracepoints | ptrace ops, `process_vm_*`, `/proc/*/mem` writes, `memfd_create`+exec (fileless) | planned | T1055, T1620 | #265 |
| **Identity & privilege** | journald | sshd accept/fail, PAM sessions, sudo/su → `Auth` | used | T1078 | #93 |
| **Identity & privilege** | eBPF · tracepoints | `setuid`/`setresuid`/`capset`/`setns` | planned | T1548, container escape | #266 |
| **Persistence & autostart** | journald + rules | systemd unit first-start (flagged approximation, documented); rc/cron/systemd path writes via the file stream | used | T1543.002, T1053.003 | #93 |
| **OS security verdicts** | netlink · audit | SELinux AVC denials — already on the socket, one classifier arm away | evaluated | T1562-adjacent | matrix row |
| **Tamper & anti-forensics** | eBPF · tracepoints | module loads/unloads, `bpf(2)` loads (eBPF-rootkit visibility) | planned | T1547.006, T1562 | #264 |
| **Tamper & anti-forensics** | eBPF · tracepoints | kernel-side kill tracing filtered to agent/security targets — SIGKILL **sender** attribution userspace cannot see → v21 `Signal` | planned | T1562 | #362 |
| **Download provenance** | inventory | no OS-level mark on Linux — browser artifacts only | planned | provenance context | #87 |
| **Devices** | device-control | USB attach/detach + policy | planned | T1091, T1052 | #84 |
| **Containers** | /proc | cgroup → container-id attribution on every event | used | container context for all rules | #80 |
| **Host state** | inventory | diffed snapshots (packages, units, cron) — persistence that predates the agent | planned | | #87 |

### Rejected

| Mechanism | Why |
| --- | --- |
| custom kernel module | eBPF-only stance: verifier safety, no third-party kernel code |
| ptrace interception | invasive, single-tracer conflicts, evasion tarpit |
| perf hardware counters | rejected (revisit) — niche side-channel detections; cost/benefit unproven |
| AF_PACKET / libpcap full capture | volume without need — conntrack flows (#92) + JA4/SNI (#86) carry the network signal; TLS content is cheaper pre-encryption via uprobes (#90) |
| inotify | coarser than the eBPF file events and fanotify (#34); no process attribution |
| utmp/wtmp/btmp parsing | journald (#93) carries the same logins with provenance |

## Windows

### Master sources

| Source | Mechanism | Cost & privilege (as observed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ETW** | one kernel-provider session, nine manifest-based providers | Administrator. Session name randomized per start, persisted for orphan cleanup, silence watchdog turns a stopped trace into a loud error (F-2) |
| **WEL** (Windows Event Log) | channel polling via `wevtutil` (2s) | Administrator for the Security channel. Lab-earned (ADR-0004): 7045's classic provider defeats TDH schema resolution, and the Security channel never delivered to an ad-hoc raw-ETW subscriber — `EvtSubscribe` is the evaluated successor. Per-channel allowlist + volume counters (ADR-0006) |
| **driver tier** | kernel callbacks, minifilter, WFP, Threat-Intelligence ETW | Signed driver, its own distribution tier; TI-ETW additionally needs PPL. All planned (#39) |
| **Win32 APIs** | table snapshots (`GetExtendedTcpTable`), WMI/CIM queries | Unprivileged; snapshot cadence |
| **device-control** | PnP/device-interface notifications | Planned (#84, cross-platform crate) |

### Signal coverage

| Focus | Source | What we get | Status | MITRE | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Process execution** | ETW · Kernel-Process | exec with the **real** PEB command line (F-1), per-event SID + integrity level (F-3), lineage | used | T1059 | #20 |
| **Process execution** | ETW · Kernel-Process | image/DLL loads (EID 5) | used | T1574.002 side-loading | #21 |
| **File activity** | ETW · Kernel-File | create/write (`NameCreate`+`CreateNewFile` join, F-6 partial), NT→drive-letter paths via real volume map (F-5) | used | T1105, dropper joins | #20 |
| **File activity** | driver · minifilter | authoritative deletes/renames, named pipes, ADS, raw-volume access | planned | ransomware primitives | #136 |
| **Network** | ETW · Kernel-Network | TCP connects (IPv4+IPv6 first-class F-7, dedup window), UDP sends (EID 14) | used | T1071/T1041 BEACON, T1048 | #20/#97 |
| **Network** | Win32 · GetExtendedTcpTable | listening-port snapshots + startup baseline — LISTENER-DRIFT does not exist on Windows today | planned | backdoor listeners | #366 |
| **Network** | ETW · SMBClient | SMB connections established (EID 30704; failures dropped) | used | T1021.002 | #97 |
| **Network** | driver · WFP | flows + inline block | planned | response primitive | #138 |
| **DNS** | ETW · DNS-Client | query + answer + status joined to the process (EID 3008; 3006 dropped as noise) | used | T1071.004, IOC join | #21 |
| **Encrypted traffic** | — | no mechanism evaluated yet — schannel has no plaintext-tap analog; JA4-style fingerprinting would ride the driver tier | gap | | likely #138/#39 |
| **Scripts & runtimes** | ETW · PowerShell | script blocks (EID 4104) **post-decode** — `-EncodedCommand` arrives plain, fragments reassembled | used | T1059.001, T1027 | #21 |
| **Scripts & runtimes** | ETW · AMSI | script/VBS/JS content at the scan interface | planned | T1059, T1027 | #282 |
| **Scripts & runtimes** | ETW · DotNETRuntime | **dynamic (in-memory) assembly loads only** (EID 154, `flags & 0x2`) — file-backed dropped at the sensor | used | T1620, T1055 | #97 |
| **Memory & injection** | driver · ObCallbacks+TI-ETW | handle access to LSASS; injection telemetry | planned | T1003.001, T1055 | #137 |
| **Identity & privilege** | WEL · Security | logons 4624/4625/4648/4672 → `Auth` | used | T1078, T1110 | #94 |
| **Identity & privilege** | ETW · Kerberos/NTLM/LDAP-Client | client-side ticket requests (RC4-etype shadow), NTLM validation, LDAP recon bursts — DC-side 4768/4769 stay server scope, honestly | planned | T1558, AD recon | #364 |
| **Identity & privilege** | WEL · TerminalServices | RDP session lifecycle | planned | T1021.001 | #285 |
| **Persistence & autostart** | WEL · System+Security | service install 7045, scheduled task 4698, local account 4720 — flag-gated deterministic events | used | T1543.003, T1053.005, T1136.001 | #94 |
| **Persistence & autostart** | ETW · Kernel-Registry | value writes (EID 4, NT→`HKLM` normalized; reads deliberately not taken) | used | T1547.001, T1112 | #21 |
| **Persistence & autostart** | driver · kernel callbacks | process/image/registry from the tamper-resistant vantage | planned | same, authoritative | #39 |
| **OS security verdicts** | WEL · operational channels | AppLocker, WDAC, Defender, Task-Scheduler | planned | policy + AV context | #283 |
| **Lateral-movement services** | ETW · WMI-Activity | WQL queries (EID 23) + method invocations (EID 24, `Win32_Process.Create`) | used | T1047 | #21 |
| **Lateral-movement services** | ETW · BITS-Client | background transfer jobs | planned | T1197 | #284 |
| **Tamper & anti-forensics** | driver · minifilter | timestomping (SetInformation), ADS manipulation, raw-volume access | planned | T1070.006, T1564.004 | #136 |
| **Download provenance** | ETW · Kernel-File | `Zone.Identifier` ADS (mark-of-the-web) → v21 `FileQuarantine` (`HostUrl`/`ReferrerUrl` read-back); minifilter supersedes | planned | T1553.005 | #365 |
| **Devices** | device-control | Windows collectors land with the cross-platform crate | planned | T1091 | #84 |
| **Host state** | Win32 · WMI/CIM | point-in-time inventory; Sysmon-channel opt-in is an ADR-first decision | used / planned | pre-existing persistence | collectors; #286 |

### Rejected

| Mechanism | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Userland API hooking / detours | stability, AV conflicts, trivially unhookable — ETW + kernel callbacks only |
| Clipboard capture | privacy/noise cost exceeds detection value; commercial norm agrees |
| Raw packet capture (WinPcap/npcap-style) | ETW network + WFP (#138) carry the signal without the driver and volume cost |
| Keystroke / screen capture | privacy line, same reasoning as clipboard |
| Execution-history artifacts (Prefetch, Amcache, Shimcache) | rejected (deferred) — point-in-time forensics, not streaming telemetry; DFIR workbench territory (M10), pulled on demand |
| WMI event watchers as a telemetry source (`Win32_ProcessStartTrace` & co.) | the pre-ETW era's mechanism — polling latency and provider gaps; ETW supersedes it wholesale (watching *attackers'* WMI subscriptions stays in scope via #21/inventory) |

## macOS

### Master sources

| Source | Mechanism | Cost & privilege (as observed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ES** (`EndpointSecurity`) | one entitled client, NOTIFY-only subscriptions flattened through a C shim compiled against the SDK's own headers | Root + ES entitlement + Full Disk Access. **Live-verified**: amfid SIGKILLs an ad-hoc restricted entitlement at exec (error -424), before TCC — Apple grant or SIP+AMFI-relaxed lab only. Self-muted against feedback; per-family OS-version guards. AUTH (blocking) is M6 |
| **unified log** | `log stream --style ndjson` under a strict predicate; three volume gates (daemon predicate → exact-message classifier → counted sliding-window shed) | Admin scope. Formats undocumented by Apple — pinned by verbatim live-capture tests, the OS-update tripwire. Live-validated end to end |
| **NE** (`NetworkExtension`) | Swift system extension (filter-data + DNS-proxy providers) → versioned NDJSON over an app-group socket to the agent | Restricted entitlements + user/MDM approval (`packaging/macos`); wire skew counted, never guessed. Seam + typed scaffold on `main`; activation outstanding (#351) |
| **libproc/sysctl** | table snapshots | Unprivileged — works before any Apple grant |
| **DiskArbitration / IOKit** | disk + device attach/detach notifications | Planned (`device-control`); unprivileged for notifications |
| **inventory** | scheduled state snapshots | FDA for the TCC.db snapshot |

### Signal coverage

| Focus | Source | What we get | Status | MITRE | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Process execution** | ES · exec | argv + the kernel's code-signing state at the source (`CS_VALID`, signing/team id, platform-binary bit), lineage | used | T1059, unsigned-binary-ran | #32 |
| **File activity** | ES · file events | open/create/rename/unlink; mmap **filtered to writable+shared** (dyld torrent dropped in-shim); POSIX `O_*` flags so cross-platform write rules apply unchanged | used | T1105, T1485/T1486, T1070.004 | #32 |
| **File activity** | ES · widening | quarantine **strip**, timestomp, hidden flags, APFS clone/exchangedata staging, remount | planned | T1070.006, T1564.001 | #357 |
| **Network** | NE · filter-data | flows with audit-token attribution (inbound + outbound) → `Connect`, close-time byte counts → `NetworkFlow` — BEACON consumes macOS flows unchanged | built | T1071/T1041 | #33/#351 |
| **Network** | libproc/sysctl | listening-port snapshots + baseline — the one source needing **no entitlement** | planned | LISTENER-DRIFT parity | #358 |
| **Network** | ES · mount | mount/unmount (DMG delivery, USB staging) → v21 `Mount` | used | staging, evidence destruction | #96 |
| **DNS** | NE · DNS-proxy | proxied query/response with process attribution → `DnsQuery` (RCODE in `status`) | built | T1071.004, domain↔process join | #33/#351 |
| **Encrypted traffic** | NE · filter-data | TLS ClientHello peek → SNI + JA4 (Linux #86 parity) | planned | C2 fingerprints | #360 |
| **Scripts & shells** | — | no macOS analog taken yet — interactive-shell visibility would be the Linux readline uprobe's sibling | gap | | matrix candidate |
| **Memory & injection** | ES · widening | task-port acquisition, ptrace, remote thread creation, CS invalidation, suspend/resume, RWX mprotect, pty — the coverage-matrix promise #32/#96 only partially landed | planned | T1055, T1562 | #355 |
| **Identity & privilege** | ES · sessions | SSH/console/loginwindow logins → `Auth` (13+) | used | T1078 | #96 |
| **Identity & privilege** | unified log · sudo | sudo outcomes → `Auth`; ES-native su/sudo supersedes on 14+ | used / planned | T1548.003 | #95; #356 |
| **Persistence & autostart** | ES · BTM | launch-item registration — deterministic, the macOS 7045 (payload path + instigator); launchd/cron path writes via the file stream | used | T1543.001/.004, T1547.015 | #32 |
| **Persistence & autostart** | ES · widening | Open Directory account manipulation, configuration-profile installs (14+) | planned | T1136.001 | #356 |
| **OS security verdicts** | unified log · syspolicyd+tccd | Gatekeeper scan verdicts (Mach-O only — scripts log `performScan` without a verdict, observed live); TCC grant/deny joined on tccd's msgID (client redacted → #354) | used | delivery context, TCC-probing recon | #95 |
| **OS security verdicts** | ES · widening | XProtect malware verdicts, Gatekeeper **user override**, native TCC modify with client identity (15.4+) | planned | OS's own AV verdict for free | #356 |
| **Tamper & anti-forensics** | ES · signal | signals **filtered to ES-client targets** (this agent, other security tools), sender attributed | used | T1562 | #96 |
| **Tamper & anti-forensics** | ES · widening | kext loads, sensitive IOKit user-client opens | planned | T1547.006, keylogger preludes | #357 |
| **Tamper & anti-forensics** | ES · XPC | XPC connects (14+) — rules match sensitive service names, never per-event | used | agent-impersonation surface | #96 |
| **Download provenance** | ES · quarantine | quarantine xattr + `kMDItemWhereFroms` read-back → v21 `FileQuarantine` (agent, origin + referrer URLs) — the network→file link | used | provenance | #96 |
| **Devices** | DiskArbitration/IOKit | disk/volume + device attach/detach | planned | T1091, T1052 | `device-control` |
| **Host state** | inventory | pre-existing launch items, kexts/system extensions, profiles, the standing TCC-grant map, browser artifacts | planned | persistence that predates the agent | #359 |

### Rejected

| Mechanism | Why |
| --- | --- |
| ES read-side metadata events (stat, lookup, getattrlist, readdir, access, …) | pure volume without mutation — nothing a detection keys on that the write-side events don't already carry |
| NetworkExtension packet-tunnel provider | rejected (revisit) — full-packet capture is cost without need given filter-data + DNS |
| kexts / kauth | deprecated and disallowed by Apple |
| openbsm audit trail | deprecated; ES supersedes |
| FSEvents | coarser than ES file events; no attribution |
| DTrace | requires SIP disabled — a dev-machine tool by construction, not deployable telemetry |
| ASL / legacy syslog | superseded by the unified log (#95 reads the successor) |

Cross-platform note: download provenance is one shape on all three platforms —
Windows mark-of-the-web (#365), the macOS quarantine xattr (shipped, #96), and
browser artifacts via `inventory` — all feeding the platform-neutral
`FileQuarantine` event: the provenance link between a network event and a
dropped file.
