# ATT&CK Coverage Assessment

Hand-written snapshot (assessed 2026-09-22) of MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise
coverage: which techniques the agent **detects** today, which it merely
**sees**, which wait on planned telemetry, and which are out of scope with a
reason. This is the manual predecessor of #74's generated matrix (structured
technique fields on `Detection` + a `tools/attack-coverage` generator); once
that lands, this file is replaced by generated output and never hand-edited
again.

Two layers of honesty this table enforces:

- **Detected ≠ visible.** A 🟢 means named detection content exists (a rule,
  a correlator chain, a flagged event a rule consumes). A 🟡 means the
  telemetry lands in the pipeline — the ML scorer and correlator see it — but
  no content names the technique. Turning 🟡 into 🟢 is *content* work
  (M5), tracked by the coverage-pack issues below.
- **Endpoint scope.** ATT&CK Enterprise includes cloud/SaaS/identity-provider
  techniques (Cloud Accounts, Email Collection via M365, …) an endpoint agent
  never observes; those are the plane's integrations territory (M9/M10) and
  are listed once under "Out of endpoint scope", not per tactic.

**Legend:** 🟢 detection content on-device · 🟡 telemetry visible, no
dedicated content · 📋 waits on a filed issue (telemetry or content) ·
⚪ assessed, out of scope here — with per-platform triplets **L**inux /
**W**indows / **M**acos where coverage differs.

Engine tags as of this assessment (from `rules`/`correlator` source):
T1021.002, T1036.005, T1037.004, T1041, T1048.003, T1053.003/.005, T1055,
T1059 (+.001/.004), T1070.001/.002, T1071 (+.004), T1105, T1110, T1127, T1136.001,
T1204, T1218, T1490, T1543.001/.002/.003, T1547.015, T1571, T1611, T1620. Sigma-imported content carries its
own tags (pipeline: #73); YARA/intel content is #60/#82 territory.

## Out of endpoint scope (⚪, one list)

Cloud/SaaS/IdP tactics and techniques (Cloud Accounts, cloud-service
discovery/dashboard techniques, M365/email collection, OAuth abuse, CI/CD
supply chain) — the agent never observes the control planes involved; they
belong to the server's integrations (M9/M10). Physical/peripheral exotica
(firmware ROMs T1542 beyond boot integrity by the updater/watchdog,
hardware implants) — no deployable telemetry surface for a userland agent;
revisit only where the driver tier (W #39) adds vantage.

## The path to "all techniques"

1. **Telemetry-gated rows (📋)** — every one already has a filed issue
   (#136–#138/#39, #264–#267, #351/#355–#357, #362–#366, #371–#374).
2. **Content-gated rows (🟡)** — six coverage-pack issues (M5) turn
   visible-but-unnamed into detected, each a checkbox list per technique:
   #376 initial-access/user-execution · #377 credential-access ·
   #378 discovery/lateral · #379 defense-evasion ·
   #380 collection/exfiltration · #381 privilege-escalation/impact.
3. **Structured fields + generation** — #74 replaces this file with a
   generated matrix so it can never drift from the engines again.
