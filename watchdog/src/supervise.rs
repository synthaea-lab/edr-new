//! The supervision loop — layer 1 of kill resistance, identical on every OS: spawn
//! the agent, watch it, respawn on exit. (Layer 2 is the service manager restarting
//! the watchdog itself — see [`crate::service`].)
//!
//! Crash-loop dampening (#101): a fixed `restart_delay` alone means an agent that
//! crashes on startup (bad config, missing rules content, a panic on a corrupt
//! store) respawns in a tight loop forever — CPU/log/journal churn, with the
//! service-manager layer (layer 2: `sc failure`, `RestartSec`, launchd
//! `ThrottleInterval`) piling its own restarts on top. [`Backoff`] doubles the
//! delay (capped) on each *fast* crash and resets to the floor once the agent
//! has run long enough to be considered healthy again — see its doc for the
//! exact rule. The two layers stay out of each other's way: the watchdog owns
//! agent-level backoff here, the service manager still owns watchdog-level
//! restart at its own fixed cadence.
//!
//! Liveness (#102): a process can be alive (`try_wait` sees it running) and
//! still be doing nothing — deadlocked, wedged on a poisoned lock, its sensor
//! thread dead while the main thread parks. For an EDR that is the worst
//! failure mode: the endpoint looks protected while collecting nothing.
//! [`HeartbeatMonitor`] polls the progress-backed heartbeat file
//! `agent::heartbeat` writes (advances only when the sensor pipeline actually
//! processes an event end to end) and, after `miss_limit` consecutive checks
//! see no advance, kills the child — feeding the same [`Backoff`] a crash
//! would, per #102's "same path as a crash, feeding the backoff (#101)".
