# Dynamic linker hijack scenario (T1574.006, issue #363/#401).
#
# check_ld_preload_hijack (crates/rules/src/stateless.rs) fires when an ExecEvent's
# captured LD_PRELOAD/LD_AUDIT value (issue #363: parse_proc_environ_security reads
# /proc/<pid>/environ for a fixed allowlist — presence only, never the full
# environment) points outside the dynamic linker's own trust set. That trust set
# (crates/rules/src/ld_trust.rs) is two layers, not just LD_TRUST_PREFIXES: the
# built-in baseline (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib, /usr/lib64, /usr/local/lib) plus
# whatever /etc/ld.so.conf (and its `include`s) declares on the host — except
# /tmp, /var/tmp, and /dev/shm, which are never trusted even if ld.so.conf lists
# them. This scenario is that shape with no payload beyond proving the hook
# actually loaded: the "hijack" library's constructor writes one line to a file
# and does nothing else — no hooked libc symbols, no hiding, no backdoor. What a
# real LD_PRELOAD rootkit (Azazel, Jynx2, vlany, ...) does with that same
# loaded-constructor moment is out of scope here by design; this scenario asserts
# the detection surface, not a live implant.
#
# Usage:
#   1) terminal A: sudo target/release/agent run
#   2) terminal B: ./lab/scenarios/ld-preload-hijack.sh
#   3) expected in terminal A:
#      T1574.006 — pid=...: LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/edr-test-preload.so loads a shared
#      object outside the dynamic linker's trusted search path
