#![no_std]
//! # sensor-linux-wire
//!
//! The ring-buffer ABI between the eBPF probes (`../ebpf`, `bpfel-unknown-none`) and
//! the userspace loader (`../userspace`): fixed-size `repr(C)` structs written by the
//! kernel side and read back with `read_unaligned` on the user side. Both crates must
//! be built from the same revision — this is an internal ABI, not a stable format.
//!
//! These types are deliberately NOT the agent's event model: the loader normalizes
//! them into `schema` types. The fixed limits below are wire/kernel constraints (the
//! eBPF stack is 512 bytes and events are built in place on it), not product limits —
//! truncation at these bounds is a sensor property reported by conformance.
//! `ExecEvent` is built in a `PerCpuArray` because `image` alone already exceeds the
//! stack budget.

/// Bumped on every layout-affecting change to the structs below. Not a wire header
/// (ring-buffer items carry none) — a build-time tripwire: the userspace loader
/// `const _`-asserts the value it was compiled against, so an ebpf/userspace version
/// skew fails the build instead of misreading bytes at runtime.
///
/// - v1: initial exec/open/connect structs.
/// - v2: `ExecEvent` gains `image`/`image_len` (authoritative image path from the
///   tracepoint, issue #111) and `pcomm` (parent name from the fork-lineage map,
///   issue #53). `cmdline` is unchanged (`mm->arg_*` blob).
/// - v3: `ExecEvent` drops `cmdline`/`cmdline_len` — argv is read from
///   `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` by the userspace loader (issue #152), so the probe no
///   longer touches a `task_struct`/`mm_struct` frozen offset at all.
/// - v4: `EventMeta` gains `cgroup_id` (`bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()`, captured at
///   probe time, issue #204) — closes the drain-time `/proc` exit race for
///   container attribution: the userspace loader resolves it against cgroupfs
///   instead of `/proc/<pid>/cgroup`, which no longer needs the pid to still exist.
/// - v5: `TlsCaptureEvent` and `ReadlineInputEvent` added for uprobes (issue #90).
///   TLS capture budgeted at 256 bytes (first N bytes of plaintext), readline at
///   512 bytes (full interactive command line).
/// - v6: `FileWriteEvent`, `FileDeleteEvent`, `FileRenameEvent` added (issue #262).
///   `FileWriteEvent` carries no path — `write(2)`/`pwrite64(2)` take a file
///   descriptor, not a path, and this codebase resolves no `fd`→path mapping
///   (kernel-side `d_path`/`bpf_d_path` nor a userspace `/proc/<pid>/fd/<n>`
///   lookup); it is a volume/frequency signal (burst-write detection), not a
///   per-write path trail. `FileDeleteEvent`/`FileRenameEvent` read real path
///   arguments straight off the syscall, same as `FileOpenEvent`.
/// - v7: `SocketBindEvent` added (issue #263) — `bind(2)` only. Same
///   family-filtered (`AF_INET`/`AF_INET6`) sockaddr read as `ConnectEvent`;
///   `listen(2)` (no address, just `fd`+`backlog`) and `accept(2)`/`accept4(2)`
///   (needs a `sys_exit` probe to read the kernel-filled peer address — a new
///   probe shape this crate doesn't have yet) are deliberately deferred.
/// - v8: `SocketAcceptEvent` added (issue #263 Phase 2) — `accept(2)`/`accept4(2)`.
///   First use of the paired `sys_enter_*`/`sys_exit_*` probe shape in this crate:
///   the peer address is only populated by the kernel once the syscall returns, so
///   `sys_enter_accept{,4}` stashes the caller's `(fd, addr_ptr)` in an in-kernel
///   map keyed by `pid_tgid` (internal to the ebpf crate, not part of this wire
///   ABI — same pattern as `sensor-linux-uprobes`' `SSL_READ_ARGS`), and
///   `sys_exit_accept{,4}` reads the return value (the new fd, or a negative errno)
///   and, on success, the now-populated sockaddr from the stashed pointer. Only
///   emitted on success — a failed `accept()` has no peer to report.
