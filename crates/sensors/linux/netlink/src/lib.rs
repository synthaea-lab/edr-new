//! # sensor-linux-netlink
//!
//! Kernel netlink families as a supplementary, zero-probe source:
//! - `sock_diag` — periodic socket-table snapshots (listening/established with
//!   inode→pid join): listen-port telemetry and drift detection without a probe.
//! - `nfnetlink conntrack` — flow accounting (bytes/packets/duration per flow),
//!   giving beacon detection volume/periodicity features events alone lack.
//! - proc connector — fork/exec/exit notifications as a cheap cross-check for the
//!   eBPF stream (a gap between the two is itself a tamper signal).
//!
//! No special kernel config; runs where eBPF cannot; complements, never replaces,
//! the probe-based sensors.
//!
//! **Status (issue #92, foundation):** `sock_diag` is done — [`snapshot`] queries
//! TCP listening/established sockets (IPv4 + IPv6) via a hand-rolled
//! `NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG` client ([`wire`]/[`socket`]) and joins each one to its
//! owning PID(s) by scanning `/proc` ([`proc_join`]), the same technique `ss`/
//! `lsof` use. Verified against this dev machine's real kernel — no root needed
//! (confirmed empirically: `sock_diag` for TCP works unprivileged, unlike
//! conntrack below).
//!
//! **conntrack is also done** — [`conntrack_socket::dump`] queries the kernel's
//! conntrack table (IPv4 + IPv6) over `NETLINK_NETFILTER`/`ctnetlink`
//! ([`conntrack_attrs`]/[`conntrack_socket`]), decoding each flow's 5-tuple
//! (both directions), status, timeout, and packet/byte accounting when the
//! kernel provides it. This is the recursive `nlattr` tree (`CTA_TUPLE_ORIG` ->
//! `CTA_TUPLE_IP` -> `CTA_IP_V4_SRC`) that made conntrack "a full netlink
//! sub-protocol of its own" rather than a `sock_diag`-sized job — confirmed
//! against a real capture on this dev machine byte for byte before being
//! pinned into tests. Accounting (`CTA_COUNTERS_*`) requires
//! `net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1` on the target kernel — off by default,
//! confirmed empirically (no counters attribute appears at all until it is
//! turned on) — see [`conntrack_socket`]'s doc. Unprivileged reachability of
//! conntrack is not characterized (every capture here ran as root).
//!
//! **`CTA_PROTOINFO`'s TCP state is also decoded** — [`TcpState`], from
//! `CTA_PROTOINFO` -> `CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP` -> `CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP_STATE`, a
//! third level of `nlattr` nesting beyond the tuple's two. Only present for
//! TCP flows — confirmed against a real capture on this dev machine: UDP
//! dump entries carry no `CTA_PROTOINFO` attribute at all. The sibling
//! `CTA_PROTOINFO_TCP_WSCALE_*`/`_FLAGS_*` sub-attributes are decoded on the
//! wire but not surfaced — not needed for beacon volume/periodicity
//! features, same scoping call as `CTA_STATUS`'s individual `IPS_*` bits.
//!
//! **proc connector** (`NETLINK_CONNECTOR`, fork/exec/exit) is a separate,
//! independent foundation slice — see PR #179, not part of this one.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** here yet:
//! - No `schema::Event` variant or [`schema::sensor::Sensor`] implementation:
//!   volume/periodicity beacon features and the eBPF cross-check both need
//!   `crates/correlator`/`crates/tamper` wiring that doesn't exist for this data
//!   yet — nothing to push into today.
//! - UDP sockets — `sock_diag` supports them, but "listen/established" (this
//!   issue's own wording) is TCP-state terminology; UDP would need its own
//!   category, not a states-mask filter.
//! - Periodic re-snapshotting / drift detection between snapshots — [`snapshot`]
//!   is a one-shot query; a caller decides the cadence. No lab VM here to
//!   validate the issue's "listening-port drift" done-when item against.
