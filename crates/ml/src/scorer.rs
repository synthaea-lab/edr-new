//! On-device ML scoring: runs an Isolation Forest (ONNX) through onnxruntime
//! (`ort`, statically linked — ADR-0002) and pairs every score with the per-feature
//! attribution from [`crate::forest`], so a detection is never a bare number
//! (`docs/detection/ml.md`).
//!
//! A model is loaded as data from the update channel, never embedded
//! ([`CmdlineScorer::from_onnx_bytes`]). One model file feeds both paths: `ort`
//! executes the graph for the score, and the same bytes are parsed into a [`Forest`]
//! for attribution — so the explanation always describes the model that produced the
//! score.
//!
//! - [`CmdlineScorer`] (T0) scores one command line the instant an `Exec` arrives;
//! - [`correlation::CorrelationScorer`] (T2) scores a pid's behaviour over the
//!   correlator window once it is populated, and feeds the correlator's belief state
//!   rather than alerting on its own.
