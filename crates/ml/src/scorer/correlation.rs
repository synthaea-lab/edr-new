//! On-device behaviour scoring (T2): runs the correlation Isolation Forest (ONNX)
//! over a pid's [`crate::features::correlation`] vector and turns the anomaly score into a
//! log-odds term for the correlator's Bayesian belief state.
//!
//! Distinct from [`super::CmdlineScorer`] (T0) in every axis that matters
//! (2026-08-27 decision, `docs/detection/correlation.md`):
//!
//! - **temporal** — a cmdline is ready the instant an `Exec` arrives; this vector
//!   only once the correlator window holds several events for the pid;
//! - **statistical** — counts and spans, not text shape, so a separate model;
//! - **output** — T0 alerts on its own budget; T2 has *no standalone threshold in
//!   v1*. [`CorrelationScorer::score`] produces a number, [`score_to_llr`] turns it
//!   into evidence, and the correlator fuses that evidence into
//!   `BeliefState::log_odds` alongside the hand-calibrated per-feature LLRs. The two
//!   scorers still alert independently (OR) — T2 just makes T1 quicker to believe.
//!
//! The correlator cannot call this crate (`ml` already depends on `correlator` for
//! [`EventBus`]; the reverse edge would be a cycle). The wiring is therefore
//! "compute here, inject there": the agent runs the scorer against the engine's bus
//! and hands the LLR back through the correlator's public API. That seam is not in
//! this crate yet — see `docs/detection/correlation.md`.
