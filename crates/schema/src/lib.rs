//! # schema
//!
//! The platform boundary of the agent: the normalized event model shared by every
//! sensor, the rule engine, the correlator, and the ML feature extractors, plus the
//! [`sensor`] contract every platform sensor implements.
//!
//! ## Semi-frozen API
//!
//! Every crate in the workspace depends on this one. Changes to public types ripple
//! everywhere and need explicit justification in review — prefer additive changes
//! (new fields with serde defaults, new [`Event`] variants) over reshaping what exists.
//! Any change visible in serialization bumps [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] and adds a new
//! `tests/fixtures/v<N>/` directory; existing fixture files are never edited.
//!
//! ## What this crate is not
//!
//! Not the wire format. Sensors normalize their platform's native representation into
//! these types; fixed-size `repr(C)` structs for the eBPF ring buffer live with the
//! Linux sensor pair (`sensors/linux`), ETW layouts with `sensors/windows/etw`. The
//! old iteration let the eBPF wire format (fixed 256-byte buffers, `TASK_COMM_LEN`)
//! define the shared model; that is deliberately undone here — command lines and paths
//! are unbounded owned strings (Windows encoded-PowerShell command lines run to
//! kilobytes), and user identity is per-platform instead of a bare Unix uid.
