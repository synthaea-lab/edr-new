"""Model record — the machine-parsable half of a model card.

Every registry entry has a human-readable ``card.md`` alongside its
``model.onnx`` (see ``ml/registry/README.md``). The card documents purpose,
metrics, FP rate, scenario-replay results and known limitations for a reader.

``model_record.json`` sits next to it, capturing exactly what a machine needs
to answer:

* "was this model trained on the datasets its card claims?" — the pre-existing
  binding, still enforced by hashing each baseline's content against
  ``sample_sha256``;
* "was this model replay-validated against the scenarios its card claims,
  and did those replays pass?" — the new binding introduced by ADR-0009,
  matched by hashing each scenario yaml against
  ``ScenarioReplayResult.scenario_yaml_sha256`` and by re-computing the
  ``passed`` field from the recorded counts.

Both are enforced at ``verify_training_record`` time and, through it, at
``verify_provenance`` time in the release gate.

Layout inside a version directory::

    ml/registry/<model>/<version>/
        model.onnx           # the artifact
        card.md              # for humans
        model_record.json    # for machines — this module writes/reads it

The record binds each ``DatasetVersion`` by its ``baseline_sha256`` (the
content hash the manifest already publishes), not by path — a dataset can move
on disk without invalidating the record, but a mutated baseline cannot pass
``verify_training_record`` even if it kept the same path. The same principle
applies to scenario yamls via ``scenario_yaml_sha256``.

Renamed from ``training.json`` in ADR-0009: the record now covers scenario
replay outcomes on top of dataset binding — no longer a "training" concept but
a full model-lifecycle record. Schema version bumped 1 → 2; readers reject v1
(matches the ``manifest.py`` pattern). No on-disk migration was required:
``training.json`` had never been materialised in the repo when this rename
landed (verified pre-ADR).

    """Re-verify one ``ScenarioReplayResult`` against on-disk state.

    Two checks (ADR-0009):

    * ``scenario_yaml_sha256`` matches the current content hash of
      ``scenarios_root/<scenario_name>.yaml``.
    * Re-computing the passing criterion from the recorded
      ``expected_detections`` and ``observed_detections`` agrees with the
      cached ``passed`` field (a mutated cache is caught).

    The gate does *not* re-run the scenario; it verifies the record's
    self-consistency and its binding to the source yaml.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the source yaml is missing.

) -> None:
    """Re-verify every ``DatasetVersion`` and every ``ScenarioReplayResult``
    in the model record against on-disk state.

    The release gate calls this before shipping a model. Two families of
    checks:

    * **Dataset provenance** (schema v1 semantics, unchanged): each dataset
      version's ``baseline_sha256`` and ``sample_count`` must still match the
      on-disk baseline's current manifest. Baseline moved → fail. Baseline
      mutated → fail.
    * **Scenario replay provenance** (schema v2, ADR-0009): each replay's
      ``scenario_yaml_sha256`` must still match ``scenarios_root/<name>.yaml``,
      and the recorded ``passed`` value must agree with a re-computation of
      the passing criterion (catches a mutated cache).

    Args:
        model_dir: The registry version directory.
        baselines_root: The parent directory holding baselines by name, e.g.
            ``ml/datasets/baselines/``. Each ``DatasetVersion.name`` is looked
            up as ``baselines_root/<name>/``.
        scenarios_root: The directory holding scenario yaml sidecars, e.g.
            ``lab/scenarios/``. Each ``ScenarioReplayResult.scenario_name`` is
            looked up as ``scenarios_root/<name>.yaml``.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the model record itself, any referenced
            baseline directory or its manifest, or any referenced scenario
            yaml, is missing.
        ValueError: If a referenced baseline's current hash or sample count
            no longer matches what the record locked, or a referenced
            scenario yaml's current hash or a cached ``passed`` no longer
            matches.
