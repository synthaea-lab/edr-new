//! `agent` — entry point of the Synthaea agent.
//!
//! Walking-skeleton scope (issue #8): sensor -> schema -> rules -> sinks in one
//! process. The correlator, ML scoring, and Sigma engines join the pipeline as their
//! crates are migrated (M2) — `DetectionSink` is where they plug in.
//!
//! Layout: `commands` carries all the `cfg(target_os)` (sensor selection, rule
//! seeding); `sink` the agent's `EventSink` wiring events into the detection engines
//! and the output sinks; `heartbeat` the progress-backed liveness signal the
//! watchdog polls (#102); `silence` per-sensor silence detection via
//! `tamper::heartbeat`, wired into the health beacon and a real local alert (#71);
//! `integrity` periodic re-verification of the installed binaries against the
//! signed release manifest `updater` persisted at promote time — the real root of
//! trust `silence` alone cannot provide (#71/#30, Linux only);
//! `protected` watches the agent's own on-disk footprint for a foreign writer (#71);
//! `kill_loudness` attributes who sent a catchable termination signal before the
//! agent actually dies (#71).
