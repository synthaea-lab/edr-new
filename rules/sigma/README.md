# rules/sigma

Sigma rules evaluated on-device by the `sigma` engine crate. Layout: one directory per
platform, descriptive file names (the directory carries the platform, so no `lnx_`/
`win_` infix): `linux/base64_pipe_shell.yml`, `windows/powershell_encoded.yml`.

Every rule must stay inside the engine's supported subset (`crates/sigma` docs) — the
engine rejects out-of-subset rules loudly at load time, and CI enforces it: the
content workflow runs the sigma crate's content test, which loads this whole tree and
asserts every rule both parses AND fires on a crafted matching event
(`crates/sigma/tests/content.rs`). Adding a rule means adding its matching sample
there — a rule nothing can trigger is dead content.
